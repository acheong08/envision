			<h1>The Bullshit of Prompt Selling</h1>
			<h4>TL;DR: Prompt selling is unprofitable for both parties</h4>
			<p>
				There are many aspects of selling a prompt that simply do not make sense for both buyers and
				sellers. I will list some of the obvious ones here.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The seller does not hold copyright over the prompt.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Just as one cannot copyright a description of an object, one cannot reserve the right
							to type in a string of text
						</li>
						<li>
							The buyer can legally share the prompt or any derivative of it with anyone they want.
							A good prompt will be shared. It is thus unprofitable for prompt sellers.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					A person with reasonable common sense can easily derive the prompt from the image with
					some trial and error.
				</li>
				<li>
					The prompt does not matter. With enough tries, anyone can stumble across a seed that
					provides optimal results
				</li>
			</ul>
