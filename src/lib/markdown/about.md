Stable Diffusion and its derivatives are slow to update due to the vast amounts of training that it undergoes between each release. Many recent styles, objects, and characters are thus missing from the main models. Embeddings trained by independent users are thus a lifesaver for niche generations.

However, over the past months, I have found it difficult to find the embeddings I want. Existing indexes are slow to update and decentralized, making it a mess to search through.

I thus created this site to facilitate the exchange of models and make it easier to search.
